            - Loop through each user ID
                - Extract the username
                - Filter the correct submissions with matching user ID
                - Filter the incorrect submissions with matching user ID
                - Add a new entry to `scores` with the user's name and their score (correct.length - incorrect.length)

            Example of `score` at the end of this: 
            {
                Kayla: 12,
                Darwin: -1
